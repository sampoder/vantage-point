Welcome to our second issue - the stressful time due to the global pandemic, the new year filled with uncertainty ahead, student life manifesting itself through examinations, our brains, our beings becoming unbalanced. All of these led us to the topic of this issue - mental health. We wanted to reflect the minds of many at this time and share with you a bit of what mental health itself is, as well as the various branches stemming off of it.

We are not psychologists in any way, and we are not telling you how to think. We have simply shared personal experiences coupled with research within the pages of the magazine. You can find articles behind the science of mental health, a personal account (with tips!) of someone dealing with anxiety, a look at the stress from hearing the news, including an interview with a student from Beirut, and questions answered by Mr. Dunk, our schoolâ€™s counselor.

We hope you find out something new and connect to the experiences and pieces, all the while hearing the voice of your fellow school citizens. Of course, please do know that we are not claiming to be medical professionals, and remember that you are able to reach out to the school counselors or support mentors at any time!

Enjoy!
